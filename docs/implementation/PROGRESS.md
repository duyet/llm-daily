## 📝 Notes

### Implementation Strategy
1. Follow phases sequentially where dependencies exist
2. Parallelize dashboard and analytics work after Phase 3
3. Test continuously, don't accumulate debt
4. Update this file after each task completion

### Team Coordination
- Use GitHub Issues for task assignment
- PR reviews required before merging
- Daily standup (async) in Discussions
