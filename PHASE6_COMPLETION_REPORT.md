#### Testing Patterns & Best Practices

All tests follow professional vitest patterns:

1. **Proper Mocking**
   - File system mocking with vi.mock()
   - Logger mocking for output verification
   - Process.exit() mocking for CLI testing
   - Proper async mock handling

2. **Test Isolation**
   - beforeEach cleanup of mocks
   - afterEach restoration of spies
   - Independent test scenarios
   - No test interdependencies

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Happy path tests for each command
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Invalid input scenarios
   - Boundary conditions

4. **Code Quality**
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Logical test organization in describe blocks
   - Proper assertions with meaningful messages
   - Mock verification for interaction testing
